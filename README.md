A screensaver for my 'steambox'; a minimal hyprland setup that automatically runs hypridle and Steam from hyprland.conf on login.

It launches swayimg pointed at a directory of images that are displayed as a slideshow, spawns processes to listen for input, then kills all the processes after detecting it.
